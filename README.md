# calculator
The Odin Project - Project: Calculator

Started 3/11/2023
-- Was able to make a basic html file, style some with CSS with custom font and learned enough about grid to layout.
-- Took way too long trying to figure out why my element properties were null. 
-- Sorted out the JS logic, then while attempting to clean it up... I broke it again.
** Take aways: Use "defer", it helps avoid the nulls. Commit often, in case you break it in a new way.

Commit 3/15/2023
-- Was hard to focus at work today, felt like I had unfinished business with this calculator. Left early.
-- Used pen and paper to sort out the JS logic again, then used breakpoints in dev tools and tracked variables to debug.
-- Tested enough to feel happy about my progress, but not enough to actually find a bug and take the wind out of my sails.
** Plans: Change the = button to a backspace button, make whole project more responsive, make it a little prettier.
